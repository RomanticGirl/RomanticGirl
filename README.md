Hello i'm ***Mich√®le Watanabe*** ***(men!)*** </br>
If you want a ***mutual subscription***, then contact me on any ***social network (links in BIO)*** . </br>
I just don't mutually subscribe to random subscribers, ***I don't need popularity***. </br>
For cooperation, or ***if you just want to have me on your "friends" list***, then ***let me know about it***. </br>
***I value my profile and interact here with friends*** I know personally. 
I develop projects for myself or for competitions, hackathons, and try to develop interesting ideas. </br>
I'm a friendly person, but I don't want to blindly subscribe to those who just fill up a counter for themselves and then unsubscribe or something like that.
This is written in view of the invasion of incomprehensible subscribers who subscribe and unsubscribe or give me asterisks on repositories that are of no value and I cannot count them even for the slightest praise. </br>
I hope for your understanding, there are different ways for communication where you can at least just say hello to me, so that I feel more comfortable, if it is important to you that I subscribe to you too or put likes on you.
</br>
